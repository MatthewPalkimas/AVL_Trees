AVL Trees

In this repository there is a database.txt that is a file to be read by the .cpp
This creates a balanced AVL Tree from the data in the file.
If you would like to play around with the tree you can.
You can build the AVL tree from anything but right now it is built out of 'person' nodes.
The remove also doesn't work 100% currently. It is more difficult than I first imagined.

A perfectly balanced binary tree search has an average time complexity of log base 2 of N.
A perfectly structured AVL binary tree are much easier to construct than an ordinary binary tree.
The time complexity of an AVL tree search has a worst possible case of only 44% more time than
the best case possible for full binary tree. The best case for AVL trees is also still log base 2 of N.
The only thing is the operations are more complex.
Comparing to no balance of worst case of N this is incredible. 

Have fun!
