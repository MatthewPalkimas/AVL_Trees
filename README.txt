AVL Trees

In this repository there is a database.txt that is a file to be read by the .cpp
This creates a balanced AVL Tree from the data in the file.
If you would like to play around with the tree you can.
You can build the AVL tree from anything but right now it is built out of 'person' nodes.
The remove also doesn't work 100% currently. It is more difficult than I first imagined.

Have fun!
